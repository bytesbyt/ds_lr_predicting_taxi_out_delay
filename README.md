# Predicting Taxi-Out Delay

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts **taxi-out delay** for flights using Linear Regression machine learning model. The goal is to analyze factors affecting delays and build predictive models to improve airport operations.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation using RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset (`M1_final.csv`) contains flight-related data.
- Features include weather conditions, airport congestion, and aircraft details.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytesbyt/ds_lr_predicting_taxi_out_delay.git
   cd ds_lr_predicting_taxi_out_delay

2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the jupyter notebook: ds_predicting_taxi_out_delay.ipynb
